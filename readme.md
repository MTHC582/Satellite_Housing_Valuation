# Satellite Housing Valuation: The "ENGINE + BRAIN" Approach

### _A Multimodal Deep Learning Pipeline for Real Estate_

> **"Combining the raw calculation power of numbers (ENGINE) with the visual intuition of satellite imagery (BRAIN)."**

This project implements a **Multimodal Neural Network** that fuses traditional tabular data (bedrooms, sqft, location) with high-resolution **Satellite Imagery** to predict property values. By "looking" at the neighborhood context (greenery, density, road proximity) via a CNN, the model captures value drivers that spreadsheets alone miss.

## Project Overview

**The Challenge:** Traditional valuation models relying solely on spreadsheets (Tabular Data) fail to capture "Curb Appeal" or "Neighborhood Vibes."
**The Solution:**

- **The ENGINE (Tabular Branch):** A Feed-Forward Network (FFN) processes exact housing specs (bed, bath, sqft) using `pandas` and `openpyxl`.
- **The BRAIN (Visual Branch):** A ResNet-based CNN processes satellite images to extract environmental features.
- **The Data:** A custom dataset of **22,000 properties**, with imagery programmatically fetched via the **Mapbox Static API**. (Took about 2.3 GB of DATA,as per the mentioned tools)

## NOTE:

I used **Python 3.11** as it ensures compatibility with the specific CUDA-enabled PyTorch wheels used in this project. To avoid dependency conflicts, I strongly suggest using the same version.

## Source Code Guide

### data_fetcher.py:

- The Collector.
- Takes the Excel file with Latitude/Longitude coordinates.
- Connects to the Mapbox Static API (or Google Maps).
- Downloads a satellite snapshot for each property and saves it as ID.jpg in the data/images folder.

### dataset.py:

- The Data Pipeline.
- Loads the Excel file using pandas.
- Handles missing values (fills with 0 or mean).
- Locates the corresponding image in data/images/ based on the Property ID.
- Applies image transformations (Resize to 224x224, Convert to Tensor).

### models.py:

- The Brain & Engine.
- Defines the ValuationModel class.
- Image Branch: Uses a ResNet-style Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract visual features.
- Tabular Branch: Uses Fully Connected Layers (Linear -> ReLU) to process numerical data.
- Fusion: Concatenates both outputs and passes them through a final regression layer to predict price.

### train.py:

- The Teacher.
- Sets up the training loop (Forward Pass -> Loss Calculation -> Backpropagation).
- Uses MSELoss (Mean Squared Error) to measure accuracy.
- Optimizes weights using the Adam optimizer.
- Saves the model with the lowest validation loss as best_model.pth.

### predict.py:

- The Valuator.
- Loads the trained best_model.pth.
- Runs inference on a random sample of validation data.
- Prints a clean table comparing Actual Price vs. Predicted Price.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

We faced several hurdles getting the GPU environment stable. Here are some tips to avoid them:

### 1. Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled:

- This happens if you just run pip install torch. You must install the specific CUDA version.  
  Use the command given in requirements.txt or run:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

### 2. Image Loading Errors:

- Ensure your data/images folder is structured simply as a list of files (1234.jpg, 1235.jpg).
- If the code crashes on a missing image, dataset.py is designed to skip it or handle it gracefully—check your terminal logs for warnings.
